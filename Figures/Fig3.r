# This data is from a trial of 42 leukaemia patients. Some were treated 
# with the drug 6-mercaptopurine and the rest are controls. The trial was 
# designed as matched pairs, both withdrawn from the trial when either 
# came out of remission.

# This data was published on CRAN in package MASS (one of the foundational
# contributed packages) supporting Venables and Ripley's 2002 book
# "Modern Applied Statistics with S". This dataset has been around for
# a long time. Sources include:
