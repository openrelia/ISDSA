This repository provides images for all figures and scripts to generate them.
For “WeibullR an R Package for Webull Analysis for Reliability Engineers”
presented at:

The 2019 Meeting of The International Society for Data Science and Analytics
July 6-8, 2019 Nanjing, China

 

Note: That generation of  figures 6 through 8 required a development version of
the WeibullR package at the time of presentation. The content of these figures
will require altered code as WeibullR is moved to newer CRAN releases. For this
reason the source package for WeibullR version 1.0.11.7 will be maintained at:
