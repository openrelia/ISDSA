For the 2019 Meeting of The International Society for Data Science and Analytics
July 6-8, 2019 Nanjing, China the presentation on WeibullR included work that
was then under development. Since this package is intended to be altered
considerably before next release to CRAN this development version 1.0.11.7 will
be maintained here in a frozen state.

This package must be built from sources. R packages Rcpp and RcppArmadillo are
required.

Windows users may wish to refer to instructions on building R packages from
sources at:

Â 

Operating systems other than Linux will require the suitable build chain for R.
